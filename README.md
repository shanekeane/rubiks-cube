# rubiks-cube
There are two elements here. Firstly, I have created an object corresponding to a standard 3x3 Rubik's cube. Secondly, I will later add a method for solving any Rubik's cube state automatically.

# Description
- The cube is defined using a class within the folder "rubiks". To import the class run "from rubiks.cubes import Cube".
- A demo notebook is included showing how the class works.
- This will later be used to create a machine learning model to solve the cube.

# Packages
Works with:
- Python 3.8.10
- Numpy 1.24.2
- Matplotlib 3.7.1
